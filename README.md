  LDTS_10_03 - Pacman
</h1>

**Pacman** is a text-based adaptation of the classic *Pacman* game, developed using Java and the **Lanterna** library.
In this game, players control Pacman through an arena, collecting coins, power-ups and avoiding pursuit by the iconic
ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. With a simple interface, the goal is to recreate the
nostalgia of the original game while exploring the SOLID principales and design-patterns.
